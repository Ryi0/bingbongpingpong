This is just a mental exercice for myself. I forbid myself from using calculators, uml and other sketched out plans, or from using ai (except to generate the random words array) to complete the assignment. 
This is to improve my context memory and problem solving skills. I know that most of the methods inside of the project are redundant. 
However, they make it easier to work with as I do not have any plans except the ideas in my head to complete the assignment.

Feel free to join the challenge and keep it fair.
